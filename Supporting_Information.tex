%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript. It will not be copyedited if the paper is accepted.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample as needed.

\noindent\textbf{Introduction}

This supplement presents the resolution test in our study, the derivation of the stopping criterion, effect of density ratio, cohesion, and moduli ratio on stress models.

\vspace{10mm} %5mm vertical space

\noindent\textbf{Resolution Test}
\vspace{10mm}

We create stress models with element sizes ranging from 1 to 8 km to examine the effect of mesh resolution on $\sigma_{D}$ and $\phi_{\max}$ using the SFR25 domain geometry. We perform the resolution test by comparing the displacement components and differential stress in the entire domain in each model with respect to the model with element size of 1 km. We determine the errors in differential stress, for example, using the equation:
%
\[
 E\sigma_{D}^{4km} = \frac{[\sum_{k=0}^n (\sigma_{D}^{4km} - \sigma_{D}^{1km})_{k}^2]^\frac{1}{2}}
{[\sum_{k=0}^n (\sigma_{D}^{1km})_{k}^2]^\frac{1}{2}},
\]
%
where k represents the index for data points and $ E\sigma_{D}^{4km} $ is the error in $\sigma_{D}$ in model with element size of 4 km relative to 1 km.

This resolution test shows that the error generally increases with mesh resolution (Fig. \ref{S1}). %For example, the model has an error of about 0.02 and 0.16 in the $\sigma_{D}$ and $\phi_{\max}$ in element size of 2 km relative to 1 km, respectively (Fig. \ref{S2}). The error values increase to 0.06 and 0.26 when the element size is 4 km. 
The errors in displacement components and differential stress in models with element sizes of 2 km is less than 5 \% of the corresponding values in the model with 1 km resolution. The errors are less than 10 \% for models with element sizes below 4 km. In our study, we will use an element size of 2 km for our fault models. However, due to expensive computation time, we will use an element size of 4 km to evaluate model parameters, e.g., coefficient of friction.

\end{figure}

\vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space

From $\Delta$ABC in Fig.~\ref{S2}, the illustration of the Mohr circle and the Byerlees law, we get
\[
 \sin \alpha = \frac{\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3}}{2} / \left[\frac{250}{3} + \frac{\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{3}}{2} \right].
\]
%
%\[
% \sin \alpha = \frac{3(\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{3})}{3(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{3})+500},
%\]
%
After simpligying and solving for $\sigma_{1}$, we ge the following expression:
\[
 \sigma_{1} = \frac{\sigma_{3}+[\sigma_{3}+\frac{500}{3}] \sin(\alpha)}{1-\sin \alpha}.
\]

Based on Byerlee's law, $\tau$  = 50 MPa + 0.6$\,\sigma_n$, under the assumption of absence of pore-fluid pressure along the rift faults, $\tan \alpha = 0.6$, hence, $\sin \alpha = 0.5145$. $\sigma_{3}$ corresponds to the lithostatic stress amounting to 250.0 MPa at 10 km depth for a density of 2.55 kg/m$^{3}$.
%\add[EC]{for a density of XXXX kg/m$^{3}$}. 
With these values and the above expression, we get $\sigma_{1}$ = 956.5 MPa.
%\annote[EC]{956.5}{Pay attention to the number of significant figures! I don't think our calculations can afford 7 or 8-digit precision so I rounded off the original value leaving 4 digits.} MPa. 
The differential stress at 10 km depth with no pore-fluid pressure, defined as $\sigma_{D} = \sigma_{1} - \sigma_{3}$, is 706.5 MPa.

%\note[EC]{Turn the first long phrase into a sentence. Right now it reads like a figure caption but it shouldn't in a normal paragraph.} The percentage change in differential stress ($\Delta\sigma_{D}^{\prime}$), SH$_{\max}$ orientation ($\phi_{\max}$), and the change in $\phi_{\max}$ ($\Delta\phi_{\max}$) relative to the reference model (SNFR25) for models with different impact structure-crust density ratio (Fig. \ref{S3}).  

We explore the effects of density reduction from 0 to 20 \% in a series of models in which the rift faults dip at 70$^{\circ}$ (i.e., SD70R25) (Fig. \ref{S3}). No significant changes in the model results were found in these models. In this study, we choose the density ratio of 10\% to represent damaged crustal rock.

\noindent\textbf{Effects of no impact structure (SD70R100 model)}

We compute $\Delta \sigma_{D}^{\prime}$, $\phi_{\max}$ and $\Delta \phi_{\max}^{\prime}$ in the SD70R100 model (Fig. \ref{S4}). The model exhibit the effects of the rift faults since the impact structure and the crust have the same elastic moduli.

$\Delta\sigma_{D}^{\prime}$ shows increased $\sigma_{D}$ relative to SNFR25 throughout the entire length of the rift faults at and below 15 km depth, hence the model predicts earthquakes in those regions.

\noindent\textbf{Effects of impact structure-crust moduli ratio}

We run 4 models in total to assess the effects of impact structure-to-crust moduli ratio assuming that the impact structure was softened (Fig. \ref{S5}). The ratio equal to 1, for instance, means that the impact structure was not softened and thus has the elastic moduli with those of the surrounding crust. The models show a better spatial correlation with the observed seismicity when the moduli ratio is 0.25.

\noindent\textbf{Effect of cohesion}

We compute $\Delta \sigma_{D}^{\prime}$, $\phi_{\max}$ and $\Delta \phi_{\max}^{\prime}$ in a series of models in which the rift faults dip at 70$^{\circ}$ (i.e., SD70R25) but their cohesion ($C$) is varied from 0 to 30 MPa while the friction coefficient ($\mu$) is fixed at 0.3 (Fig.~\ref{S6}). We assume that the fault parameters are the same for each of the three rift faults and uniform throughout the fault surfaces. %Six models with 0, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 30 MPa are constructed (Fig. \ref{S6}).

%\vspace{10mm} %5mm vertical space

\begin{figure}[ht]
\setfigurenum{S6}

Magnitudes of $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime}$ % and \annote[EC]{$\phi_{\max}$}{Fig. S6B doesn't support this.} 
decrease with increasing cohesion. $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime}$ maps spatially overlap with the distribution of seismicity %for all the fault cohesions, especially well 
when the cohesion is less than 5 MPa with about 70\% of the hypocenters fall in the region with $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime} \ge$ 0.5\% (Fig. \ref{S6}A). %The percentages of the hypocenters in the region with $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime} \ge$ 0.5\% decrease to 61\% and 47\% for cohesion values of 20 and 30 MPa, respectively.
%\annote[EC]{, especially well when the cohesion is less than 5 MPa}{What makes you say so? Can't you use the new metric for this argument?} (Fig. \ref{S6}A). 
However, the models could not explain a few earthquakes in the SW corner of the crater, where $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime}$ is negative. The $\Delta\sigma_D^{\prime}$ is not affected by a change in cohesion between 0 and 5 MPa. However, $\phi_{\max}$ approaches the reference no-fault model as the cohesion increases (Fig. \ref{S6}B). As cohesion increases, $\Delta\phi_{\max}$ decreases in value and the rotation is concentrated in the fault region outside the crater (Fig. \ref{S6}C). $\Delta\phi_{\max}$ is up to 10.8$^\circ$ when the cohesion is less than 5 MPa. We present models with zero cohesion in the main text to explain the spatial distribution of observed seismicity in the CSZ.

%\note[EC]{Why do you make remarks on $\mu$ mentioning cohesion only little in the paragraph for the effects of cohesion?} Figure \ref{S6} suggests that $\mu$ is an essential fault parameter needed to explain the seismicity of the CSZ because the value of $\mu$ affects the slope of the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. We present models with zero cohesion in the main text because to explain the spatial distribution of observed seismicity in the CSZ.
