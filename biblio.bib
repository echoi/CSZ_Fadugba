Most intraplate earthquakes are concentrated in specific seismic zones along or adjacent to large-scale basement structures (e.g., rifts or sutures at ancient plate boundaries) within continental crust. The major intraplate seismic zones are limited to specific segments and are not distributed along the lengths of the ancient structures. We present a new hypothesis that major intraplate seismic zones are restricted to places where concentrated crustal deformation (CCD) is overprinted on large-scale basement structures. Examples where CCD affects the stability of specific parts of large-scale structures in response to present-day stress conditions include the most active seismic zones in central and eastern North America: Charlevoix, Eastern Tennessee, and New Madrid. Our hypothesis has important implications for the assessment of seismic hazards.}

We investigate this hypothesis on earth by examining whether terrestrial impact structures show higher rates of nearby earthquake activity than do surrounding intraplate regions. For 28 of 30 probable impact structures having an original crater 20 km or more in diameter, the rates of nearby seismicity have been no higher than the regional background rates. For two large probable impact structures, Vredefort and Charlevoix, with higher than normal rates of nearby seismicity, factors other than slip on impact-induced faults appear to control the occurrence of earthquakes. We conclude that impact-induced faults, at least on earth, do not persist as lithospheric “weak zones” for periods in excess of several million years after the impact event.}

abstract = {Abstract— On the basis of detailed field investigations and the study of impact breccias at the Charlevoix impact structure (Québec), a structural analysis is given. This analysis shows that the annular arrangement of both topography and lithology can be applied to subdivide the two craters discussed in this review. Successive rings characterize the central uplift and its collapsed ring graben in the Charlevoix structure. Fault breccias show an annular distribution and indicate diverse directions of movement suggesting progressive readjustment. They formed cohesionless products inside fault planes, named mylolisthenite, and are believed to have acted as lubricants during the modification stage of the formation of the structure: listric readjustment by gravity after the formation of the transient crater. The Sudbury Structure (Ontario) shows fault breccias in a concentric arrangement similar to that of Charlevoix. It may be compared with the Charlevoix structure by applying the same mechanical readjustment model with deep listric faults. The only difference is the amount of the rise structural uplift, that is, the height of central uplift, which is less important in the larger impact structure.}

Our results indicate that a strike-slip earthquake is unlikely to jump a fault step wider than 5 km, in correlation with field observations of moderate to great-sized earthquakes. We also find that dynamically propagating ruptures can jump both compressional and dilational fault steps, although wider dilational fault steps can be jumped. Dilational steps tend to delay the rupture for a longer time than compressional steps do. This delay leads to a slower apparent rupture velocity in the vicinity of dilational steps. These “dry” cases assumed hydrostatic or greater pore-pressures but did not include the effects of changing pore pressures. In an additional study, we simulated the dynamic effects of a fault rupture on ‘undrained’ pore fluids to test Sibson's (1985, 1986) suggestion that “wet” dilational steps are a barrier to rupture propagation. Our numerical results validate Sibson's hypothesis by demonstrating that the effect of the rupture on the ‘undrained’ pore fluids is to inhibit the rupture from jumping dilational stepovers. The basis of our result differs from Sibson's hypothesis in that our model is purely elastic and does not necessitate the opening of extension fractures between the fault segments.}

abstract = {This paper discusses Coulomb failure criteria for brittle deformation of intact rock and fault gouge. Data are presented from laboratory experiments designed to identify the critical gouge layer thickness required to effect a transition from the standard Coulomb criterion to a modified failure law (referred to as Coulomb plasticity) appropriate for simple shear of a gouge layer. Experiments were carried out using tension fractures and quartz powder to simulate granular fault gouge. Fractures sheared without gouge obey the standard Coulomb law. A 0.6mm-thick gouge layer was required to effect the transition to Coulomb plasticity. I test and reject the hypothesis that fault zone strength and apparent coefficient of internal friction can be predicted from fracture of intact rock simply by accounting for differences in the failure laws and without considering variations in the Coulomb parameters. The data presented indicate that the stress state required for Coulomb plasticity is not developed within very thin gouge layers. This work implies that brittle fault zones have lower friction than predictions based on the strength of intact rock. However, the magnitude of this weakening effect is small (for example, a coefficient of sliding friction of 0.75 would be reduced to 0.6) and thus it is not an independent explanation of the apparent weakness of mature faults.}

The GPS network shows coherent southeastward motion of 0.6 ± 0.2 mm yr−1, relative to North America, and uplift of 2.6 ± 0.4 mm yr−1. Network average horizontal strain rates are mostly ESE-WNW shortening at (1.7 ± 1.0) × 10−9 yr−1. The shortening rate across the Charlevoix seismic zone is about twice as big as the regional average. These measurements are consistent with both postglacial rebound (PGR) models and the deformation style indicated by earthquake focal mechanisms. Although the GPS data do not discriminate between various models of crustal deformation, they provide important constraints on large earthquake recurrence. Assuming that the GPS strain estimates are representative of seismic moment release, they constrain the maximum magnitude of truncated Gutenberg-Richter recurrence statistics in the Charlevoix seismic zone to MX = 7.8 ± 0.6 (one M ≥ 7 earthquake per 400–1300 years). The remarkable agreement between the GPS strain rates, seismic catalogue statistics, and PGR predictions suggests that in Charlevoix, most of the PGR-driven crustal strain may be released by large (M ≥ 7) earthquakes. In the rest of the Saint Lawrence valley, PGR strain rates are significantly larger than seismic strain rates, suggesting either that PGR deformation remains mostly elastic or that large events are more frequent than indicated by small earthquake statistics (i.e., characteristic earthquakes).}

abstract = {We investigate the pressure distribution with depth in regions undergoing horizontal shortening and experiencing crustal thickening both analytically and numerically. Our results show that, in a convergent tectonic setting, pressure can be considerably higher than lithostatic (the pressure resulting from the weight of the overburden). Increases in pressure with respect to lithostatic conditions result from both the contribution of horizontal stresses and the flexural vertical loads, the latter generated by the deflection of the upper crust and of the mantle because of the presence of topographic relief and a root, respectively. The contribution of horizontal stresses is particularly relevant to the upper crust and uppermost mantle, where rocks are thought to deform brittlely. In these domains, pressure gradients twice lithostatic can be achieved. The contribution of horizontal stresses is less important in the ductile domains as differential stresses are progressively relaxed; nevertheless, the effects are still noteworthy especially close to the brittle–ductile transition. Flexural vertical loads generated by the deflection of the upper crust and lithospheric mantle are relevant for rocks of the weaker lower crust. As a result of the combination of the two mechanisms, the pressure gradient varies vertically through the lithosphere, ranging from negative (inverted) gradients to gradients up to several times the lithostatic gradient. The pressure values range from one to two times the lithostatic values (1ρgz to 2ρgz).},

As a result of these factors, the brittle crust is stronger than it would be under near-lithostatic pore pressure conditions. This result provides a constraint on models of lithospheric deformation. Postulating that the upper and lower crust and lithospheric mantle are totally coupled and that the total strength of the lithosphere is equal to the magnitude of tectonic driving forces (∼3×1012Nm−1), we have calculated lithospheric strain rates under representative thermal and rheological conditions such that the integrated differential stress over the entire thickness of the lithosphere equals the plate driving force. For a strike-slip stress state and surface heat flow of 60±6mWm−2, average strain rates are approximately 10−18s−1 under hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressure conditions, and approximately 10−15s−1 under near-lithostatic pore pressures. The latter strain rates are higher than either observed geodetically using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), or estimated on the basis of plate tectonic reconstructions. Hence we argue that hydrostatic upper crustal pore pressures enable lithospheric plates to behave rigidly over time scales of tens to hundreds of millions of years."

Whereas seismic activity on extensional normal faults in the arc-backarc Taupo volcanic zone is restricted to \\&lt;8 km depth in a high heat-flow, near-hydrostatic fluid-pressure regime undergoing vigorous hydrothermal convection, rupturing along the thrust interface of the contractional Hikurangi subduction margin and in its hangingwall extends to ∼25 km depth in crust with fluids overpressured towards lithostatic values. The contrast in fluid-pressure levels stems partly from the abundance of low-permeability mudrocks in the forearc and partly from superior containment of overpressures by a compressional thrust-fault regime. Maximum supportable levels of differential stress and fluid pressure are critically interdependent in the overpressured regime of the Hikurangi subduction margin. Frictional instability leading to fault rupture in such settings may be triggered by increasing fluid pressure as well as by accumulating shear stress, so that nucleation and recurrence of earthquake ruptures are likely to be affected by cycling of fluid pressure through fault-valve action as well as by stress accumulation. Coupling across the subduction interface is also likely to be highly sensitive to the degree of overpressuring. Different factors are responsible for the localization of active deformation within the two crustal seismic belts. Within the magmatically active Taupo volcanic zone, thermal weakening is clearly responsible for concentrating seismicity and deformation with respect to the surrounding crust. However, in the hangingwall of the Hikurangi subduction margin, where heat flow has been reduced by subduction refrigeration and frictional interaction extends to ∼25 km depth, relative weakening arises principally from reduction of frictional resistance by fluid overpressuring.}",

These last suggest involvement of predominantly aqueous fluids over a broad depth range, with implications for fault shear resistance and the mechanics of normal fault reactivation. A general downwards progression in fault rock assemblages (high-level breccia-gouge (often clay-rich) → cataclasites → phyllonites → mylonite → mylonitic gneiss with the onset of greenschist phyllonites occurring near the base of the seismogenic crust) is inferred for normal fault zones developed in quartzo-feldspathic continental crust. Fluid inclusion studies in hydrothermal veining from some footwall assemblages suggest a transition from hydrostatic to suprahydrostatic fluid pressures over the depth range 3–5 km, with some evidence for near-lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure cycling towards the base of the seismogenic zone in the phyllonitic assemblages. Development of fault-fracture meshes through mixed-mode brittle failure in rock-masses with strong competence layering is promoted by low effective stress in the absence of thoroughgoing cohesionless faults that are favourably oriented for reactivation. Meshes may develop around normal faults in the near-surface under hydrostatic fluid pressures to depths determined by rock tensile strength, and at greater depths in overpressured portions of normal fault zones and at stress heterogeneities, especially dilational jogs. Overpressures localised within developing normal fault zones also determine the extent to which they may reutilise existing discontinuities (for example, low-angle thrust faults). Brittle failure mode plots demonstrate that reactivation of existing low-angle faults under vertical σ1 trajectories is only likely if fluid overpressures are localised within the fault zone and the surrounding rock retains significant tensile strength. Migrating pore fluids interact both statically and dynamically with normal faults. Static effects include consideration of the relative permeability of the faults with respect to the country rock, and juxtaposition effects which determine whether a fault is transmissive to flow or acts as an impermeable barrier. Strong directional permeability is expected in the subhorizontal σ2 direction parallel to intersections between minor faults, extension fractures, and stylolites. Three dynamic mechanisms tied to the seismic stress cycle may contribute to fluid redistribution: (i) cycling of mean stress coupled to shear stress, sometimes leading to postfailure expulsion of fluid from vertical fractures; (ii) suction pump action at dilational fault jogs; and, (iii) fault-valve action when a normal fault transects a seal capping either uniformly overpressured crust or overpressures localised to the immediate vicinity of the fault zone at depth. The combination of σ2 directional permeability with fluid redistribution from mean stress cycling may lead to hydraulic communication along strike, contributing to the protracted earthquake sequences that characterise normal fault systems."

abstract = "Promise of resolving the paradox of overthrust faulting arises from a consideration of the influence of the pressure of interstitial fluids upon the effective stresses in rocks. If, in a porous rock filled with a fluid at pressure p, the normal and shear components of total stress across any given plane are S and T, then  are the corresponding components of the effective stress in the solid alone. According to the Mohr-Coulomb law, slippage along any internal plane in the rock should occur when the shear stress along that plane reaches the critical value  where σ is the normal stress across the plane of slippage, τ0 the shear strength of the material when σ is zero, and ϕ the angle of internal friction. However, once a fracture is started τ 0 is eliminated, and further slippage results when This can be further simplified by expressing p in terms of S by means of the equation  which, when introduced into equation (4), gives From equations (4) and (6) it follows that, without changing the coefficient of friction tan ϕ, the critical value of the shearing stress can be made arbitrarily small simply by increasing the fluid pressure p. In a horizontal block the total weight per unit area Szz is jointly supported by the fluid pressure p and the residual solid stress σzz; as p is increased, σzz is correspondingly diminished until, as p approaches the limit Szz, or λ approaches 1, σzz approaches 0.For the case of gravitational sliding, on a subaerial slope of angle θ  where T is the total shear stress, and S the total normal stress on the inclined plane. However, from equations (2) and (6) Then, equating the right-hand terms of equations (7) and (8), we obtain  which indicates that the angle of slope θ down which the block will slide can be made to approach 0 as λ approaches 1, corresponding to the approach of the fluid pressure p to the total normal stress S. Hence, given sufficiently high fluid pressures, very much longer fault blocks could be pushed over a nearly horizontal surface, or blocks under their own weight could slide down very much gentler slopes than otherwise would be possible. That the requisite pressures actually do exist is attested by the increasing frequency with which pressures as great as 0.9Szz are being observed in deep oil wells in various parts of the world."}

abstract = "{Deep drilling and induced seismicity experiments at several locations worldwide indicate that, in general, the brittle crust in intraplate regions is critically stressed, pore pressures are close to hydrostatic, and in situ bulk permeability is ∼10−17 to 10−16 m2. This high permeability, three or four orders of magnitude higher than that measured on core samples, appears to be maintained by critically stressed faults and greatly facilitates fluid movement through the brittle crust. We demonstrate that such high permeabilities can maintain approximately hydrostatic fluid pressures at depths comparable to the thickness of the seismogenic crust. This leads to the counterintuitive result that faulting keeps intraplate crust inherently strong by preventing pore pressures greater than hydrostatic from persisting at depth.}",

abstract = {In the upper crust, where hydraulic gradients are typically <1 MPa km−1, advective heat transport is often effective for permeabilities k ≥ 10−16 m² and advective mass (solute) transport for k ≥ 10−20 m². Regional-scale analyses of coupled groundwater flow and heat transport in the upper crust typically infer permeabilities in the range of 10−17 to 10−14 m², so that heat advection is sometimes significant and solute advection should nearly always be significant. Analyses of metamorphic systems suggest that a geochemically significant level of permeability can exist to the base of the crust. In active metamorphic systems in the mid to lower crust, where vertical hydraulic gradients are likely >10 MPa km−1, the mean permeabilities required to accommodate the estimated metamorphic fluid fluxes decrease from ∼10−16 m² to ∼10−18 m² between 5- and 12-km depth. Below ∼12 km, which broadly corresponds to the brittle-plastic transition, mean k is effectively independent of depth at ∼10−18.5±1 m² Consideration of the permeability values inferred from thermal modeling and metamorphic fluxes suggests a quasi-exponential decay of permeability with depth of log k ≈ −3.2 log z - 14, where k is in meters squared and z is in kilometers. At mid to lower crustal depths this curve lies just below the threshold value for significant advection of heat. Such conditions may represent an optimum for metamorphism, allowing the maximum transport of fluid and solute mass that is possible without advective cooling.},

abstract = "The morphology of lunar craters degrades only slowly by the formation of new impacts and their ejecta. It is not the same on Earth because of weathering and tectonism. Generally the typical crater topography has disappeared and the term impact structure or astrobleme is applied. On planetary surfaces, as on the Moon, two classes of craters are recognized based on their depth to diameter ratio: simple bowl-shaped and complex (readjusted) flat-bottomed craters, with a sharp transition from simple to complex (Pike, 1977, 1980). On Earth, small, simple craters retain some of their typical rimmed pit morphology because they are generally recent. Many are associated with meteorite fragments. Large impact structures or astroblemes, in addition to their specific circular features, are recognized as such only by the presence of shock metamorphism criteria such as: dense minerals (coesite, stishovite), diaplectic minerals and glass (maskelynite), planar deformation features in minerals (principaly in quartz and feldspars) and shattercones which are commonly used. These criteria are abundant in allochthonous breccia, particularly in fall-back breccia among which there are glass fragments such as tectite or microtectite (glass spherules, shards, droplets, rods, etc.). But, on the floor of the astroblemes the criteria of shock metamorphism are restricted to the central part which is often covered or eroded. Using the measurements of nine astroblemes visited a scaling model is presented for two types of craters readjusted along listric slip surfaces: a well readjusted model based on data from Charlevoix and Manicouagan, Canada, and a partly readjusted model based on data from the Ries, Germany. Both possess a central uplift and a ring-graben. There is also on the floor of the astrobleme a specific type of breccia (mylolisthenite and pseudotachylite) associated with the displacement along the autochthonous masses of rocks. In very large impact structures, the shock metamorphism is able to melt a part of the floor (Grieve and Cintala, 1992). The heat resulting from the superheated impact melt destroys a part of the shock metamorphism criteria."
